/*https://leetcode.com/problems/escape-the-ghosts/
Approch:Here we have two vectors i.e., ghosts and target which define their positions. The player is at origin
(0,0). We have to calculate the distance b/w player and target which is done by simply subtracting target's x 
value from player's x and similarly y. Now, adding these 2 values gives no. of moves to reach the target by 
player since in each move, you can move 1 unit from current position. Similarly calculate distance from each 
ghost to the target.If the player takes less moves compared to all the ghosts, then he can escape.(true)
Example: 
ghosts=[[1,0][0,3]]
target=[0,1]
Distance b/w player and target=(0-0)+(1-0)=1 move
Distance b/w 1st ghost and target=abs(1-0)+abs(0-1)=2 moves
Distance b/w 1st ghost and target=abs(0-0)+abs(3-1)=2 moves
1<2
Hence, the player can escape and we print true.*/
